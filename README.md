# impaktfull_ui

A UI library of Impaktfull.

# Purpose

This UI library was built to have a simple way to build UIs for Impaktfull. This will limit the maintenance cost of open-source projects and make it easier to build applications. That way we can focus on building new tools & features instead of bugfixing and maintaining UI changes from Flutter.
